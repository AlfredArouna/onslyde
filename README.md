#Very basic instructions
<ul>
<li><a href="http://onslyde.com" target="_blank">Signup here</a> and get a session ID. Make a note of your assigned "session ID". The UI sucks right now, so after you hit the submit button it will show up in a barely visible green box above the name input.</li>
<li>Follow the directions <a href="http://onslyde.com/example-deck.html" target="_blank">mentioned in this slide deck</a>. Basically just save the HTML to disk somewhere.</li>
<li>Go to line 317 in the HTML file you just saved and replace the current sessionID value (103) with the one from your signup.</li>
<li>You now have a private session for your presentation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wesleyhales/onslyde">Come help out with the project</a></li>
</ul>

#Hosting/Uploading
Since there can be a delay in the data route from the audience remote control, then to the ws server, 
and then to the slide deck on your computer, I will happily host your HTML slide deck on the onslyde server. 
Send a pull request to this repo:
<ul>
<li>Make sure it's in a directory that is unique to your talk.</li>
<li>Follow the example from the /DevNexus folder</li>
<li>Feel free to rebrand the remote for the audience with your twitter handle etc...</li>
</ul>
